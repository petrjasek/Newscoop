2.6.0 "Joey" (July 10, 2006)
  For full details about these changes, see:
  http://code.campware.org/projects/campsite/query?milestone=2.6.0

  Major New Features
  ------------------
  - Frontend users can post comments on articles & comments can be
    moderated by the staff.
  - 'Article Types' screen re-engineered with the ability to rename
    article types, to translate them, to hide or show them, and merge
    them together. Article Type Fields can be renamed, translated,
    hidden, and can change types.
  - Improved security for the login screen.  The password is encrypted
    when it is sent to the server, and if too many unsuccessful login
    attempts are made, a CAPTCHA (an image with text inside) is
    displayed. This prevents automated scripting attacks trying to
    guess passwords.
  - Improved responses to user interaction.  The system now displays
    which action the user just performed and gives a detailed
    explaination if a particular action cannot be performed.
  - If an error occurs in the admin interface, an automated bug reporter
    takes over and allows the user to submit the bug back to the
    Campsite team automatically.  This takes away any extra effort on
    the part of the users to submit a bug and will allow quick
    resolution of anything that comes up.
  - Staff users can submit feedback directly to the Campsite team from
    within the interface.
  - Improved backup/restore scripts: you can now transfer your site
    to another server using these scripts.  Backup file are now tagged
    with the date and time of the backup.  Lots of help
    documentation has been added as well as detailed status messages
    during execution.

    'Article Edit' screen
  - Improved layout of the Article Edit screen - more compact, more
    obvious switching between the "Edit/View" modes, and the time the
    article was saved is displayed.  The article number has been added,
    as well as a link to the frontend page.

    without unlocking it.

  Major Features
  --------------
  - Ability to attach files to articles

      alongside the article.  Adding these items has been vastly
      simplified.

  Minor Features
  --------------
  - Article copy: When duplicating an article, you can now duplicate
    any number of its translations, as well as give each translation
    a new name.
  - Article translation: When you translate an article and the issue
    and/or section do not exist in the translation language, you now have
    the ability to create them at the same time you create the article

    selecting dates.

    now remembered.
  - Image archive: "View image" screen now shows all translations of
    articles that use the image.

  - Staff list: Added a "User type" column to the staff list.
  - Subscribers list can be sorted by full name, account name and
    creation date.

    when copied.
